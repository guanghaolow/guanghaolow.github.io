## Current position

Senior researcher at [Microsoft Quantum - Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/microsoft-quantum-redmond-quarc/)

## Education

- Ph.D. (2017) from the [MIT Deparment of Physics](https://web.mit.edu/physics/). My advisor was [Prof. Isaac L. Chuang](http://feynman.mit.edu/ike/homepage/index.html).
- M.Sci. and B.A. (2012) from [Christ's College of the University of Cambridge](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/).

## Research

- Push the limits of quantm computing in simulating physics, and to understand physics as a heuristic for solving computational problems. 
- I am currently interested in and have worked on quantum algorithms for simulation, machine learning, linear algebra, imaging, search, and tomography.
- I have worked on noise models and control of trapped ion quantum computing.
