Senior researcher at [Microsoft quantum - Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/microsoft-quantum-redmond-quarc/)

## Background

- (2017) Ph.D from the [MIT Deparment of Physics](https://web.mit.edu/physics/) under the supervision of [Prof. Isaac L. Chuang](http://feynman.mit.edu/ike/homepage/index.html).
- (2012) M.Sci and B.A. from [Christ's College of the University of Cambridge](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/).

## Research

- My research aims to push the limits of quantm computing in simulating physics, and to understand physics as a heuristic for solving computational problems. 
- I am currently interested in and have worked on quantum algorithms for simulation, machine learning, linear algebra, imaging, search, and tomography.
- I have worked on noise models and control of trapped ion quantum computing.

## Publications
Authorship in physics venues (e.g. Physical review) are typically ordered by contribution. Authorship in computer science venues (e.g. STOC / FOCS) are typically ordered alphabetically.
